Install:
(1)-Its a Maven JavaFX Project so use "Pom.xml" to configure and load dependencies, they are all already loaded in this "Pom.xml" that leaves them there they should only: 

----(A) - Or create a new project "Maven JavaFX Application" and load my POM.xml settings and move the .java files to your project by changing only the packages in the .java that I integrate into your project,

----(B) -O directly open my project in your editor. 

(2)-Once you have assembled the recommended project create account in "IBM Cloud" and create your own "Api Keys" and replace those that i put.

(3)-And clean and build project.


I have used NetBeans 8.2 for made the project and mvn comand promp to compile it.
